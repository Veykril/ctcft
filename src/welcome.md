## What is this meeting about?

The Rust teams and working groups have proven to be a really effective way to scale the project. As the teams have grown, though, they have come to operate more and more independently, and we need mechanisms for the whole project to stay in sync. The "Cross-Team Collaboration Fun Times" meeting (CTCFT for short) aims to be one of those mechanisms.

## What are the goals of the meeting?

* üéâ To celebrate and raise awareness of what is happening in the project.
* ‚úÖ To track progress on important efforts and communicate requests between teams.
* üí¨ To give a forum for cross-team discussion and collaboration.

## When's the next meeting?

The [meetings](./meetings.md) section gives more details about the meeting, along with the agenda for upcoming meetings. You can also check out the [CTCFT Calendar] which lists all our meetings and has Zoom links and the like.

## Are there minutes and recordings?

Yes! We typically record the meetings and link to the recordings in the meeting minutes that are published on this site.

## Can I come?

The meeting is open for anyone to observe, but we limit active participation to members of the Rust teams, working groups, project groups, and other major stakeholders in the Rust community (e.g., leads from popular crates). This is because we wish to ensure that we have a high bandwidth form of communication. If you're unsure about what level of participation makes sense for you, feel free to reach out to nikomatsakis to discuss.
