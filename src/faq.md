## Frequently Asked Questions

### Who can attend the meeting?

The meeting is open for anyone to observe, but we limit active participation to members of the Rust teams, working groups, project groups, and other major stakeholders in the Rust community (e.g., leads from popular crates). This is because we wish to ensure that we have a high bandwidth form of communication. If you're unsure about what level of participation makes sense for you, feel free to reach out to nikomatsakis to discuss.

### I have 222+ unread Github notifications in rust-lang/rust. Why is this meeting worth my time?

Alternative phrasing: [Should this meeting be an email?](https://blog.doist.com/meeting-vs-email/)

This meeting is meant to have a very high "signal to noise" ratio. It is not a place to come for general status updates, but it is a place to learn from what others in the Rust org are doing. It's also a place for us to discuss cross-cutting issues and coordinate on cross-cutting technical projects.

If you look at the reasons to have a meeting over email cite in that link, I think they lead us towards "OK, this should be a meeting":

* Is it a complex issue and you wish to talk through ideas?
    * Often, yes!
* Is it a project with a lot of vaiables involves and you want everyone on the same page?
    * Often, yes!
* Is the primary goal to build camaderie?
    * That is a goal of the meeting, yes.
* Is it a status update?
    * No, we won't include simple status updates. We will only include things that either have lessons that may be useful elsewhere or which require cross team collaboration for some other reasons.
* Does everyone have the information they need?
    * Today, not so much, but hopefully they will because we'll be having these meetings regularly. =)

One other point: because the agenda will be circulated in advance, it may be that you pick and choose which meetings to attend based on whether this is a discussion topic that you have a lot of interest in.

### Who will MC and who will assemble the meeting agenda?

[nikomatsakis] plans to do those things, but he will need help in running the meeting. If you'd like to help out, check out the `#ctcft` stream on Zulip.

### What if I have something sensitive to discuss?

For sensitive items, this is likely not the right meeting, but we can organize a "closed meeting" if desired.

### Does this really have to be synchronous?

For this to work, we need people to pay attention for an hour. We're all really busy, and asynchronous communication is all too easy to ignore. 

### What can we do to make this accessible to people around the globe?

The Rust project includes people from all over the world, and some time zones are just plain incompatible. We've put some thought into how to structure the meeting to make it accessible to folks from different time zones:

* We will alternate between different times so that folks in different time zones can more readily attend.
* We will also distribute recordings of the meeting (and perhaps consider livestreaming as well) so that people can watch.
* Per Rust's 'No new rationale' principal, we will not use the meeting to *make decisions*, particularly on controversial issues, but rather to generate discussion and distribute information. (See the next question.)

### What if I can't make some meeting or other? Am I going to miss out on key decisions?

Per Rust's 'No new rationale' principal, we will not use the meeting to *make decisions*, particularly on controversial issues, but rather to generate discussion and distribute information. This means that folks who couldn't attend the meeting can watch the recordings and then participate in the follow-up discussion.

### How will this be better or different than the project leadership sync meeting?

Some time back we attempted a [Project Leadership Sync Meeting](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/project-leadership-sync-meeting/10552). The structure was basically status reports and -- after a time -- it petered out in favor of (sparsely used) Zulip streams.

This meeting has a different structure. To start, it will have more active curation of the agenda, and it will not have a "round robin" format. We'll not be looking to find out what is going on, but rather to *distribute* the key points of that information, and to focus conversation on interesting agenda items that merit discussion.

Further, the scope of the meeting is broader. The meeting will representatives from project groups like error handling and other key efforts of the Rust project.

### How did you arrive at those times? Can we try different ones?

The timing for the meeting is something I would like feedback on. I think it's important that we make the meeting accessible, but I also think we should take into account the time zone that the majority of participants are coming from. Here is a kind of survey of possible times and how accessible they are to folks from different time zones:

Key:

* 🥰 working hours (9:00..18:00)
* 🥱 rather late (18:00..22:00) -- which could be good for some folks!
* ❌ totally unreasonable (22:00 - 9:00)
