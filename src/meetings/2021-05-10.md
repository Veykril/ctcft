    * In March, Compiler team conducted an experimental [development sprint](https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2021/02/15/shrinkmem-rustc-sprint.html). The goal was to drive engagement from contributors by offering people the chance to work in a focused fashion over a short period of time, rather than in small bursts over a long period of time. Compiler team co-leads [wesleywiser] and [pnkfelix] will discuss the experience and the lessons they took away from it.
