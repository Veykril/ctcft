# 👨‍👩‍👧 Meetings

Every CTCFT Meeting has its own page, found on the left.

## Meeting agenda

The meeting agenda will be assembled in advance and announced the day before each meeting (or more). See the [agenda document](https://hackmd.io/QZrDNeUXRsKtQuyjdpH0Pw) for details.

## Meeting recordings

Meetings will be recorded and those recordings will be posted publicly. We may even attempt to stream them. Recording the meetings serves several purposes:

* It makes the meetings accessible to folks who cannot attend in person or who must miss a week.
* The recordings of the meetings become another channel for people to follow along with what is happening in Rust.

## Rules for participation

* The meeting is open for anyone to observe ([read more](./faq.html#who-can-attend-the-meeting)).
* We will use a meeting queue to ensure everyone who wants to speak has a chance.
* The meeting queue is managed by the MC (typically [nikomatsakis]) and they will call on when you when it is time to speak.
* To add yourself to the queue, write `o/` in the chat.
* To remove yourself from the queue, write `nm` in the chat.
* Keep your video off unless you are involved in conversation or once you have added yourself to the queue. Turn it back off afterwards. 
* Stay muted when not speaking.

## Timing of the meeting

The meetings are targeted for the third Monday of every month. The timing of the meeting generally alternates between these two times. See the [CTCFT Calendar] for details.

Key:

* 🥰 working hours (9:00..18:00)
* 🥱 rather late (18:00..22:00) -- which could be good for some folks!
* ❌ totally unreasonable (22:00 - 9:00)
